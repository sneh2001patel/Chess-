This project uses Python library `pygame` to create a GUI if you do not have pygame installed already please run the following command: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To run the code please run the `main.py` file using the command
`python main.py` if you have two different versions of python install in your system please specify `python 3` when you run the program
`python3 main.py`.

If the game screen is too large for your local machine please change the `TILE` variable in settings to fit your screen.
